            <h2>Details of Mukhyamantri Amrutum Yojana</h2><br>
            <p>
                A large number of households are pushed into poverty as a result of the high costs of household spending
                on health care. The Below Poverty Line (BPL) population is especially vulnerable to catastrophic health
                risks. To address this key vulnerability faced by the BPL population in Gujarat, the State Government
                has launched a medical care scheme called Mukhyamantri Amrutum (MA) Yojana. The objective of the scheme
                is to improve access of BPL families to quality medical and surgical care for the treatment of
                identified diseases involving hospitalization, surgeries and therapies through an em panel network of
                health care providers.

                The individuals and families listed in the BPL list by the State Government are eligible under the MA
                Yojana. Furthermore, each family member should be present when enrolled under the scheme. However,
                families that belong marginally above the poverty line can be under the MA Vatsalya Yojana if they
                follow these criteria:-<br><br>
                1) The annual income of the family is up to 4 Lakhs<br>
                2) Any member(s) who are Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers<br>
                3) Any member(s) who have accredited reporters<br>
                4) Class-3 and Class-4 employees employed on a fixed payroll by the State Government<br>

                Step - 1. The eligible beneficiaries must visit the Kiosks at Taluka or Civic Centres in their area.
                Mobile
                kiosks are also available at a local level.<br>
                Step - 2. The authorities are well equipped with the needed hardware for enrolment.<br>
                Step - 3. The hardware is used to capture biometrics such as fingerprints, iris scans, and photos of the
                beneficiaries<br>
                Step - 4. The beneficiaries might even have to fill out the MA Card application form in Gujarati with
                appropriate details.<br>
                Step - 5. Once the details are verified, the MA health card is issued to the beneficiaries and the
                enrolment process is complete.</p>
